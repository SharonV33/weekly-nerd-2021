        <h2>Question of the week - What makes a front-end developer</h2>
            <p>
                Personally, i've always seen the world of front-end development divided
                into two sections; front-end designers and front-end developers. The designers mostly
                focusing on HTML and CSS, creating amazing layouts and designs for websites. The developers
                diving more into frameworks and JavaScript, working with logic and data. Using this logic
                I personally call myself more of a front-end developer over a designer, my skills lay mostly
                in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing that both front-end developers and front-end designers have in common in my opinion
                is that they are the link between designers and back-end developers. Taking a concept made by a
                designer and preparing it for the back-end developer to make it work. This is why a team can not
                exist without a front-ender, whether designer or developer. There needs to be a link made between
                a static design and a working project since neither would be complete without the other.
