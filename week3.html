            <h2>Question of the week - What left the biggest impression on me the past few weeks</h2>
            <p>
                Before this minor, I thought than I had a pretty decent understanding of coding and developing. Now I realise that that was very much not true.
                The most interesting thing I learned in the recent few weeks was the pace at which I was able to pick up new techniques like working with API's,
                Node.js and sockets. These were all new techniques for me and they felt very overwhelming but I feel that I picked them up very fast.
                Whenever I get started on learning a new technique I always feel very lost in a sea of information. This was no different the last few weeks,
                I felt like the new tools and techniques just kept piling up like a mountain. Luckily I was able to pick everything up very fastly.
            </p>
            <p>
            Coolest things I learned per subject
                <ul>
                    <li>WAFS - There is an API for everything!</li>
                    <li>CSS to the rescue - You don't always have to make a serious and easy to understand design, sometimes more fun is better</li>
                    <li>PWA - You can make a website act like a native app with a few scripts, manifests and service workers</li>
                    <li>Browser Technologies - Every browser treats techniques different, this should be kept in mind when developing</li>
                    <li>RTW - Sockets allow you to send real time updates to users</li>
                    <LI>HCD - Everyone experiences the web differently and abled people can also need accessibility tools</LI>
                </ul>
