            <h2>Question of the week - Equality in the developer world</h2>
            <p>
                As a woman in the developer world, I do often feel singled out by all the men who dominate the field. But while the amount of
                female developers is rising, there are still a few judgemental thoughts about us. For example, some companies might only hire
                a female developer to do more designer tasks than working with complex code. I feel like these judgements are most often made
                by men who have been in the business for 30 of more years. They are not yet used to how diverse the development world has become
                and are likely still convinced that web development is too complex for a woman.
            </p>
            <p>
                I myself was unfortunate enough to experience judgement based on wanting to become a female developer when applying for my MBO application
                development. During the interview I had already noticed that they did not ask me many technical questions, which was nice because I was not
                yet very well versed in tech. But after a short time the manager of the course told me I was accepted and asked me why I thought that was the case.
                Of course this was a very strange question, my first guesses were that I was ambitious and willing to learn but these were not the reason
                for me being accepted. I was told that I got in due to me being a woman. Apparently it was so important that they let women into the course
                that they did not even test my ability to code (I later discovered that all the men in my class did have to do an assignment in order to
                get accepted). I do often wonder, if I was not instantly accepted into the course, would I still have come at the point where I am now?
            </p>
            <p>
                While my experience with this gender based judgement ended working out positively, I feel like this is not the case for many other women. I assume
                that there are also a lot of women who would not get accepted into a very technical course due to being female. This could completely discourage a woman
                from getting into tech. However, the community is vastly becoming more accepting of women who like to code which is amazing. I feel like women can offer
                a different perspective on web development that men might not be able to give. This is why I believe that a female developer can only benefit a
                development team.
